**DMR Result Analysis**



Terminal results: 

1\.

hsa-mir-4251: 44 total DMRs

hsa-mir-153-2: 36 total DMRs

hsa-mir-593: 36 total DMRs



Total account of DMRs in this miRNA in all cancer. For example, there might be 4 unique DMRs but they are identified in different frequencies in all cancers (e.g., 12 times in BRCA etc.) and thus 44 is the sum of those appearances. Its about frequency "How often does this miRNA have DMRs across ALL cancers?"



2\. 

Hypomethylation Dominates:



Hypomethylated: 34 DMRs (62%)

Hypermethylated: 21 DMRs (38%)



which maybe can mean: 

1. Global hypomethylation is a pan-cancer feature
2. Potential oncogenic miRNA activation
3. loss of normal methylation control





3\. Known Cancer miRNAs Validated

**hsa-mir-593 (3 DMRs, 16 cancers, ALL Hypermethylated)**

* Tumor suppressor
* Hypermethylation → silencing (expected)
* Present in 73% of cancers (16/22) = true pan-cancer event



**hsa-mir-153-2 (3 DMRs, 16 cancers, ALL Hypomethylated)**

* Tumor suppressor
* Hypomethylation -> activation which id weird. It could mean compensatory activation in response to cancer stress, different regulatory regions that even though they lose methylation the gene body gains it, maybe it becomes oncogene in some cancers? !!!!!!!1**RESEARCH!!!!!!** 



**hsa-mir-148b (2 DMRs, 15 cancers, ALL Hypermethylated)**

 Known cancer-associated miRNA
* &nbsp;Can act as oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on context
* &nbsp;Hypermethylation in 15/22 cancers (68%) = strong pan-cancer pattern





4\. 

C19MC cluster validated: All members have identical patterns  

hsa-mir-516a-1, 516a-2, 519a-1, 519a-2, 521-1, 522, 527

All: 1 DMR, 14 cancers, ALL Hypermethylated



\# The C19MC cluster is the largest human microRNA gene cluster on chromosome 19, primarily expressed in the placenta and some undifferentiated cells. It plays a crucial role in regulating trophoblast proliferation and differentiation during early development. In relation to cancer, aberrant expression of C19MC miRNAs has been linked to tumor biology as these miRNAs can influence cell migration and invasion, and their dysregulation is observed in several cancers. Thus, C19MC contributes both to normal placental development and may impact cancer progression through its regulatory effects on cellular behavior.



Biological significance: C19MC normally expressed in placenta

Silenced in most adult tissues by methylation

In cancer: Either remains silenced (your data) OR reactivated (not your data)

Your data suggests: Increased silencing in cancer (more methylation)



5\. Let-7 Family  (let-7a-1, let-7d, let-7f-1)

All: 1 DMR, 10 cancers, ALL Hypermethylated



* Famous tumor suppressor family 
* Hypermethylation -> silencing 
* present is 45% of cancers 
* well established cancer mechanism

Cancer breakdown

BRCA, ESCA, LUSC, UCEC:	High DMR counts (many 1s,some 2-4s). Epithelial cancers show more miRNA methylation  				changes

CESC, HNSC, LIHC:	Moderate-high DMR counts

GBM, STAD, THYM	:       Very low (mostly zeros)
